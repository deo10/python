# Task2.4.1-python Refactoring

In this task, you will be seeking assistance from Copilot to refactor code. Read the [coding story](https://codingstories.io/story/https:%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fcodingstories%2Fsingle-responsibility-principle-story-python) about Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for SOLID training course. This story is about proper decomposition of classes and methods to fit Single Responsibility Principle. Using the initial code at the beginning of the story, you should:

* Identify any code smells or code areas that might be improved.
* To achieve the same refactoring plan as in the code story, use a sequence of prompts in ChatGPT.
* Implement the changes to the code.
* Verify the refactored code outputs to confirm their correctness and maximum similarity to the final code in the coding story.

It is recommended that you complete this task with the help of [EPAM Dial](https://chat.lab.epam.com/).
