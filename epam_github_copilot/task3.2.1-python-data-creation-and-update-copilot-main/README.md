# Task3.2.1-python Data Creation and Update Template

Our *investment_portfolio_performance_analyzer* function in Python is set to evaluate an investor's portfolio performance over time. To adequately test this feature, we need intricate test data that emulates real-world investment portfolios. These portfolios will have varied assets, different investment dates, and other complexities.

The function to test is in the template.

Please generate the necessary data and implement unit tests. The task will be graded according to unit test coverage.
